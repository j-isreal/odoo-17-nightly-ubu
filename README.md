## install-odoo.sh Install Script
The ```install-odoo.sh``` BASH script installs all the dependencies and the nightly build of Odoo 17 community.

This script presumes that you have a fresh install of Ubuntu 24.04.

Make the script executable with:
```
chmod +x install-odoo.sh
```

Then, run the script with:
```
./install-odoo.sh
```

Follow the on-screen directions to complete the install.




## Docker Image
I'm creating a Docker image for use with this project since there is no Odoo 17 Docker image yet.
